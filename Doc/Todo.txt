Cxbx Todo:

  General Code Cleanup [caustik]

  Use KeGetCurrentThread for fs:28h (May not be able to w/out kernel mode)
  If not, fake it by constructing a fake KTHREAD possibly. In any event,
  the current crashing method is an attempt to locate TLSData inside of a
  KTHREAD object returned by fs:28h.

  Exe->Xbe should use an "OpenXDK" logo bitmap by default. This can be done
  by having a debug version of Cxbx output the necessary raw data. Then, you
  just inline it into the code.

  Allow a logo bitmap to be added if one does not exist. This may require that
  the size of headers be increased. (sizeof_headers).

  When loading a file, menus and WM_CLOSE should be disabled and an update
  progress should be sent via callback from core.

  Xbe::m_Header should be allocated dynamically to make room for huge headers.

  TLS needs to be implemented.
