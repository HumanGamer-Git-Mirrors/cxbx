Cxbx Todo:

  General Code Cleanup [caustik]

  General debug output in Exe.cpp, Xbe.cpp, etc. Very slick :)

  High Level Emulation. Detect entry points to routines such as 
  XapiVerifyMediaInDrive, and install a vector to an emulation
  routine.

  Recent files (for .exe and .xbe) in menu. (Use registry)

  Add support for .XBE file handling capabilities through shell.
  When opening an .XBE with Cxbx, there should be an optional flag
  which will cause it to automagically generate the .Exe and start
  emulation. This used with the progress meter, etc, will make the
  emulation extremely fluid.

  Allow a logo bitmap to be added if one does not exist. This may require that
  the size of headers be increased. (sizeof_headers).

  When loading a file, menus and WM_CLOSE should be disabled and an update
  progress should be sent via callback from core.

  Xbe::m_Header should be allocated dynamically to make room for huge headers.

  TLS needs work.
