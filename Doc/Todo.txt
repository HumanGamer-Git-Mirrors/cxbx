Cxbx Todo:

  D3D Rendering window should inherit from Wnd class. The title should
  also somehow be updated with information on the playing game.

  Recent files (for .exe and .xbe) in menu. (Use registry)

  Attempt to add compatibility with ME by using LLDT assembly. This
  may not even work, but might as well try it.

  Xbe files should associate with Cxbx (by user configuration). There
  should be configuration allowing the Xbe to execute automatically
  without a GUI at all, or for the Xbe to open in the Cxbx GUI. This
  can easily be done by sending different command line options to
  Cxbx.

  Cxbx.dll should be registered in the system so that a converted .exe
  can be run from anywhere, once converted.

  Converted Exe files should use the Cxbx icon

  Allow a logo bitmap to be added if one does not exist. This may require that
  the size of headers be increased. (sizeof_headers).

  When loading a file, menus and WM_CLOSE should be disabled and an update
  progress should be sent via callback from core.

  Xbe::m_Header should be allocated dynamically to make room for huge headers.

  TLS needs work.
