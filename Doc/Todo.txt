Cxbx Todo (* denotes high priority)

  * D3D8.lib D3DDevice_SetRenderState_ZEnable@4 for 4627

  * XAPILIB XapiThreadStartup for 4627

  * Stabilize Heap Allocation (i.e. new) -> Crashes after initial commit is full

  * Stabilize TLS (it's close...)

  * 3D Textured Demo

  * Retail Games (esp. XDK 4361)

  * SetRenderState Simple for 4627 (Draw[Indexed]Vertices states are +10 up to 116, then some new ones?)

  * What does SetLastError check Irql for? Should this be emulated?

  Perfect the timing on KeTickCount

  Some sort of delete-after-emulation type of functionality?

  Use SetDataFormat instead of parsing device input by hand?

  Batch config all buttons (should be very easy..just click one by one)

  Encapsulate RecentFiles into a nice little class

  Configuration screens may not necessarily need to be modal windows.

  Multimonitor support via Direct3D9::EnumAdapterModes enumeration.

  Closing a console should not terminate the entire process.

  If possible, Direct3D Rendering window should inherit from Wnd.

  Xbe file associations via user configuration. This could include an
  option to either automatically execute the Xbe, or simply open it up
  in Cxbx's main window. For this purpose, Cxbx.dll should also be
  registered in the system so that a converted Exe can run from anywhere.

  Converted Exe files should use the Cxbx icon

  Allow a logo bitmap to be added if one does not exist. This may require that
  the size of headers be increased. (sizeof_headers).

  When loading a file, menus and WM_CLOSE should be disabled and an update
  progress should be sent via callback from core.

  Xbe::m_Header should be allocated dynamically to make room for huge headers.
