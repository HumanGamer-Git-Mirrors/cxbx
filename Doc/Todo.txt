Cxbx Todo:

  General Code Cleanup [caustik]

  * KeInitializeDpc, KeInitializeTimer, ExQueryNonVolatileSetting
  * Locate "RtlNtStatusToDosError" in Win2k/XP doc

  Add support for .XBE file handling capabilities through shell.
  When opening an .XBE with Cxbx, there should be an optional flag
  which will cause it to automagically generate the .Exe and start
  emulation. This used with the progress meter, etc, will make the
  emulation extremely fluid.

  Exe->Xbe should use an "OpenXDK" logo bitmap by default. This can be done
  by having a debug version of Cxbx output the necessary raw data. Then, you
  just inline it into the code.

  Allow a logo bitmap to be added if one does not exist. This may require that
  the size of headers be increased. (sizeof_headers).

  When loading a file, menus and WM_CLOSE should be disabled and an update
  progress should be sent via callback from core.

  Xbe::m_Header should be allocated dynamically to make room for huge headers.

  TLS needs work.
