Cxbx Todo:

  General Code Cleanup [caustik]

  - FS: structure construction (EmuXInit)

      - Initialize necessary components of EmuXFS
      - SwapFS before *all* Win32/NT calls.

  Debug outputs should be configurable to STDOUT (console) or text file.

      - Passing a ptr to CxbxKrnl is not enough (seperate process) pass the
        full DebugFilename.

  Exe->Xbe should use an "OpenXDK" logo bitmap by default. This can be done
  by having a debug version of Cxbx output the necessary raw data. Then, you
  just inline it into the code.

  Allow a logo bitmap to be added if one does not exist. This may require that
  the size of headers be increased. (sizeof_headers).

  When loading a file, menus and WM_CLOSE should be disabled and an update
  progress should be sent via callback from core.

  Xbe::m_Header should be allocated dynamically to make room for huge headers.

  TLS needs to be implemented.
